Assignment: Classwork with Javascript Part 2 <br>
Description: In this classwork, we continue working on the COVID center app that we started in a previous classwork. We already have the HTML5 and CSS3 work done, and the purpose of this classwork is to add javascript to make it more interactive. We learn how to toggle the visibility of elements based on input using JS, and we also add a function that helps validate date of birth input, making sure it is not empty or a future date, makes sure country list input is not empty, and checks for special characters in all inputs. <br>
